=============================
Patching initrd.img
=============================
Anaconda source is patched.
When moving Anaconda from version A to version B, do the following

In version A
1. untar anaconda tarball
2. for every file in patch-files/versionA/, run diff -Naur against the original
3. pipe the output of the diff into a patch file - anaconda.patch.

In version B
1. untar anaconda tarball
2. apply patch from the patchfile anaconda.patch
3. all the files that changed will have a file.orig file next to it.
4. Copy all the changed files into patch-files/versionB

Just to verify, do a diff between patch-files/versionA
and patch-files/versionB - call this DIFF X
Also do a diff between original/versionA and original/versionB - call
this DIFF Y

Compare the 2 diffs DIFF X & DIFF Y.
They should both be identical. The 2 diffs should not have
any STACKI params mentioned in them.



=============================
Patching install.img
=============================
Install.img is patched.
When moving install.img from version A to version B
In version A
1. mount install.img on dir mntA
2. for all files in A/patch-files/usr, EXCEPT usr/bin/anaconda
   create a diff patch M against mntA/usr

In version B
1. mount install.img on dir mntB
2. for all patch-files in A/patch-files/usr, execpt usr/bin/anaconda,
   copy files from mntB to B/patch-files/usr
3. Apply diff patch M

In version A
1. Create a diff patch N between A/patch-files/opt/stack/bin/anaconda_stack.py and mntA/usr/bin/anaconda

In version B
2. Copy orig mntB/usr/bin/anaconda to B/patch-files/opt/stack/bin/anaconda_stack.py
3. Apply diff patch N against B/patch-files/opt/stack/bin/anaconda_stack.py 

Copy all the other files from A/patch-files/opt to B/patch-files/opt

Create a patch I between mntA and A/patch-files (only the files that exist in the patch-files dir)
Create a patch J between mntB and B/patch-files (only the files that exist in the patch-files dir)
Compare patch I and patch J. They should be identical
