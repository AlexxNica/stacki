	"""
	Add a firewall rule for an OS type.

	<arg type='string' name='os' repeat='1'>
	OS type (e.g., 'linux', 'sunos').
	</arg>

	<param type='string' name='service' require='1'>
	The service identifier, port number or port range. For example
	"www", 8080 or 0:1024.
	To have this firewall rule apply to all services, specify the
	keyword 'all'.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='protocol' require='1'>
	The protocol associated with the service. For example, "tcp" or "udp".
	To have this firewall rule apply to all protocols, specify the
	keyword 'all'.
	</param>
	
        <param type='string' name='network'>
        The network this rule should be applied to. This is a named network
        (e.g., 'private') and must be one listed by the command
        'rocks list network'.
	To have this firewall rule apply to all networks, specify the
	keyword 'all'.
	</param>

        <param type='string' name='output-network' optional='1'>
        The output network this rule should be applied to. This is a named
	network (e.g., 'private') and must be one listed by the command
        'rocks list network'.
	</param>

        <param type='string' name='chain' require='1'>
	The iptables 'chain' this rule should be applied to (e.g.,
	INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD).
	</param>

        <param type='string' name='action' require='1'>
	The iptables 'action' this rule should be applied to (e.g.,
	ACCEPT, REJECT, DROP).
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='table'>
	The table to add the rule to. Valid values are 'filter',
	'nat', 'mangle', and 'raw'. If this parameter is not
	specified, it defaults to 'filter'
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='rulename'>
	The rule name for the rule to add. This is the handle by
	which the admin can remove or override the rule.
	</param>

	<example cmd='add os firewall linux network=private service="all" protocol="all" action="ACCEPT" chain="FORWARD"'>
	Accept all services and all protocols from the private network on
	the FORWARD chain for Linux hosts.
	If 'eth0' is associated with the private network on a Linux host, then
	this will be translated as the following iptables rule:
	"-A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT".
	</example>
